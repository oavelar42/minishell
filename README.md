<h4>Working in progress</h4>

<h3>Minishell is a pretty lenghty project. The hardest challenge so far. You have to do a lot of things and make sure everything runs smoothly and that it doesn't crash.

Minishell has 3 important parts:

- Reading your standard input.

- Parsing what you've written.

- Executing what you've parsed.</h3>
